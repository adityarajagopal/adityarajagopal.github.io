                                <p> Hi, I'm a student in my 3rd year of an MEng. Electronics and Information Engieering degree at Imperial College, London. Due to
                                the nature of the course and various internships and projects I have done in the past, I have some experience in both high level 
                                software engineering and lower level embedded programming, as well as some hardware design. Recently I have taken an interest in machine 
                                learning applications and would like to further my skills in the field. I also help run the Game Development society at Imperial College 
                                London, eventhough I am definitely not a regular gamer :)</p>

								<h2>Zynq and the MicroBlaze Softcore Processor</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								 This is currently a work under progress. As part of my placement at WesternGeco, I had to work with the Zynq SoC device. The Zynq device is a chip produced by Xilinx which has both hardcore processors (2 ARM cortex A9's) and an FPGA placed on the same chip. Using AXI interconnects, the chip allows for low latency, high throughput communication between the ARM cores, called the Processing System (PS) and the FPGA, called the Programmable Logic (PL). 
								 <br><br>
								 One of the benefits of having this tight coupling between the PS and PL is that various peripheral tasks could be offloaded onto the PL by instantiating a softcore processor on it. This makes it possible to run a much larger process with an OS on the PS, and then have smaller baremetal tasks run on various softcore processors instantiated on the PL, instead of using multithreading on the hardcore processors. 
								 <br><br> 
								 Through this page, I will be looking at various features of the softcore processor IP provided by Xilinx called the MicroBlaze processor. I will also be investigating the Xilinx microprocessor IP the MicroBlaze Microprocessor System (MicroBlaze MCS). One of the benefits of using an MCS is that it has a much smaller footprint in the PL.

								<h2>PCB Design</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								As part of my internship in WesternGeco, I had to design a PCB that was to be used for vibration testing of a particular component. The project made me familiar with the open source PCB design software KiCad. 
								<br><br>
								The final result was a 2 layered PCB with about 30 components. Accounting for track keep-out zones with various components as well as using Vcc and Gnd planes effectively were intersting challenges that I came across. 
								<br><br>
								Other interesting considerations included the effect of the distance of  decoupling capacitors from the device under consideration. Decoupling capacitors essentially behave as a smaller temporary power source for a component to satisfy any sudden spikes in the component's current draw. Hence, it is important to place them near the component we are attempting to decouple. 
								<br><br>
								Furthermore, the project also exposed me to all aspects of PCB design from good practices in creating schematics, to footprint design and track layout.

								<h2>C Compiler</h2 >
							</header>
							<p>
								In my second year of university, as part of a course on language processors, we had to develop a compiler for the C language. The project was open ended and the only requirement was to implement as many aspects of the C language as possible within the time constraints of about 2 months. This was probably one of the hardest and most time consuming projects I have worked on, but was also very fruitful in terms of the experience with coding large projects that I gained.<br><br>

								The lexing was done with the open source library Flex, and the parsing using the open source library Bison. The parsing resulted in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which was created using object oriented programming in C++. Although in hindsight, the class hierarchy was a bit too shallow with inheritance not being used to its fullest.<br><br>

								In the end, the compiler successfully compiles integer arithmetic, nested loops and conditionals, function calls, pointers and arrays, strings and scopes.<br><br>  

								The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/C-Compiler"> C_Compiler</a>. To make the executable, run <i><b>make bin/c_codegen</b></i>. To run the executable, run <i><b>{Name}.c | ./bin/c_codegen > {Name}.s</b></i>. This will generate a .s file with the MIPS assembly.
