                                <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio! At the moment, I'm a student in my 3rd year of the MEng. Electronics and Information Engieering degree at Imperial College, London. However, I was born in India, grew up in Malaysia and am currently on a 6-month placement as part of my course at a comapny called Western Geco in Norway.
                                <br><br>
                                Due to the nature of the course and various internships and projects I have done in the past, I have some experience in both high level 
                                software engineering and lower level embedded programming, as well as some hardware design. Recently I have taken an interest in machine 
                                learning applications and would like to further my skills in the field. I also help run the Game Development society at Imperial College 
                                London, even though I am definitely not a regular gamer :)</p>

								<h2>Zynq and the MicroBlaze Softcore Processor</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								 This is currently a work under progress. As part of my placement at WesternGeco, I had to work with the Zynq SoC device. The Zynq device is a chip produced by Xilinx which has both hardcore processors (2 ARM cortex A9's) and an FPGA placed on the same chip. Using AXI interconnects, the chip allows for low latency, high throughput communication between the ARM cores, called the Processing System (PS) and the FPGA, called the Programmable Logic (PL). 
								 <br><br>
								 One of the benefits of having this tight coupling between the PS and PL is that various peripheral tasks could be offloaded onto the PL by instantiating a softcore processor on it. This makes it possible to run a much larger process with an OS on the PS, and then have smaller baremetal tasks run on various softcore processors instantiated on the PL, instead of using multithreading on the hardcore processors. 
								 <br><br> 
								 Through this page, I will be looking at various features of the softcore processor IP provided by Xilinx called the MicroBlaze processor. I will also be investigating the Xilinx microprocessor IP the MicroBlaze Microprocessor System (MicroBlaze MCS). One of the benefits of using an MCS is that it has a much smaller footprint in the PL.

								<h2>PCB Design</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								As part of my internship in WesternGeco, I had to design a PCB that was to be used for vibration testing of a particular component. The project made me familiar with the open source PCB design software KiCad. 
								<br><br>
								The final result was a 2 layered PCB with about 30 components. Accounting for track keep-out zones with various components as well as using Vcc and Gnd planes effectively were intersting challenges that I came across. 
								<br><br>
								Other interesting considerations included the effect of the distance of  decoupling capacitors from the device under consideration. Decoupling capacitors essentially behave as a smaller temporary power source for a component to satisfy any sudden spikes in the component's current draw. Hence, it is important to place them near the component we are attempting to decouple. 
								<br><br>
								Furthermore, the project also exposed me to all aspects of PCB design from good practices in creating schematics, to footprint design and track layout.

								<h2> Machine Learning </h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								In my 3rd year of university, one of the modules I chose to take was called Introduction to Machine Learning. The module was a good mix between theoretical machine learning concepts and applying these concepts in practice. <br><br>

								The course was split into 4 pieces of course work, each with a focus on a different aspect of machine learning. I'll breifly describe each one and provide a link to the source code on github. <br><br>
								
								Due to my own curiosity in the matter, I decided to do each of the projects in a different languages to compare the ease of running some ML in each. The 1st project was done in R which is widely known as a big data language, the 2nd in C++ using the Eigen linear algebra library, and the 3rd and 4th in Python using various ML libraries. <br><br>

								The projects are listed in order of what I found most interesting.
							</p>

							<header> <h3> Collaborative Filtering </h3> </header> 
							<p>
								This assignment was by far my favourite one of the 4. The project essentially emulated the famous Netflix Challenge, which asked software engineers to come up with an algorithm that used users' past ratings of movies and best predicted their ratings for movies they haven't watched.  <br><br>

								The price winning submission used an algorithm called collaborative filtering along with other advanced ML concepts. The way this algorithm works is discussed in far more detail in the report found in Section 3.4 of the report in the link below. However, in short collaborative filtering learns not only the optimal classifier, but also the best features to use for classification. <br><br>

								Other interesting parts of this project was using cross validation to choose the number of features to learn on and the regularisation parameter in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Doing a large amount of cross validation was extremely resource intensive and took a long time, hence this inspired the use of multi-threading in the code in the following project. <br><br>

								This project was done in python, but the algorithms were still coded from scratch rather than using library versions of the algorithms. <br><br>

								Here's a link to the report and source code <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/ML-CW3"> Collaborative_Filtering </a>
							</p>

							<header> <h3> Support Vector Machines </h3> </header> 
							<p>
								This project looked at SVMs to classify handwriting data as well as the effect of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Details and discussion on both of these topics are provided in the report below. <br><br>

								Here's a link to the assignment, report and source code <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/ML-CW4"> SVM </a>
							</p>
							
							<header> <h3> The Perceptron Algorithm </h3> </header> 
							<p>
								This assignment focused on various implementations of the perceptron algorithm for linear classification. It was a good introduction to ML as the algorithms could be implemented from scratch without using libraries, hence giving a better feel for the way more complex libraries are implmeneted. <br><br> 

								It was fun to code it in R and the language provided good run times for matrix operations, however there was no particular syntactical benefit or runtime benefit over other similar languages such as Matlab. <br><br> 

								Here's a link to the assignment, report and source code <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/ML-CW1"> ML_Perceptron </a>
							</p>

							<header> <h3> SRM and ERM </h3> </header> 
							<p>
								This assignment focused on the difference between empirical risk minimisation and structural risk minimisation. A more detailed analysis of the difference can be found in Section 5.2 of the report on the link below. In short, ERM works by minimising the training error, i.e. it results in the classifier that has the lowest training error. However, this hypothesis may be skewed by overfitting and hence resulting in poor test case performance. On the other hand SRM aims to account for this by assigning a penalty to each hypothesis class and selecting a hypothesis class that may not have the lowest training error, but would perform the best on test sets. <br><br>

								This project was done in C++ using th Eigen library, and as I soon realised, for the short time scale and the prototyping nature of university courseworks, this language was far to precise and slow to code in. So even though I would like to do more ML projects in the future in C++, I will leave that to a final implementation and use other interpreted languages for fast prototyping. <br><br>

								<h2> Nature's Call </h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								During my second year of university, a group of friends and I founded Imperial College's Game Development society. It was started so more people get interested in coding as a fun thing to do and has steadily grown over the last year and a half. It started off intially as just a few of us who decided to put together a game, but now has about 10-20 regular members who turn up to our weekly meetings and are working on new ideas for games. <br><br>

								Here's a link to the report and source code <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/NaturesCall"> Nature's Call </a> <br><br>

								The README has a description of the controls and a link to all the asset files. <br><br>

								Here's a downloadable link to a zip folder containing the executable for the game on windows <a href="http://adityarajagopal.github.io/assets/Nature's Call.zip"> Nature's_Call_windows </a> <br><br>

								The controls are : <br>
								<b>Up Arrow</b> - Jump <br>
								<b>Down Arrow</b> - Slide <br>
								<b>Right Arrow</b> - Speed up <br>
								<b>Left Arrow</b> - Slow down <br>
								<b>S</b> - Attack <br>
								<b>A</b> - Grab onto ropes, wheels etc. <br>

								<h2>C Compiler</h2 >
							</header>
							<p>
								In my second year of university, as part of a course on language processors, we had to develop a compiler for the C language. The project was open ended and the only requirement was to implement as many aspects of the C language as possible within the time constraints of about 2 months. This was probably one of the hardest and most time consuming projects I have worked on, but was also very fruitful in terms of the experience with coding large projects that I gained.<br><br>

								The lexing was done with the open source library Flex, and the parsing using the open source library Bison. The parsing resulted in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which was created using object oriented programming in C++. Although in hindsight, the class hierarchy was a bit too shallow with inheritance not being used to its fullest.<br><br>

								In the end, the compiler successfully compiles integer arithmetic, nested loops and conditionals, function calls, pointers and arrays, strings and scopes.<br><br>  

								The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/adityarajagopal/C-Compiler"> C_Compiler</a>. To make the executable, run <i><b>make bin/c_codegen</b></i>. To run the executable, run <i><b>{Name}.c | ./bin/c_codegen > {Name}.s</b></i>. This will generate a .s file with the MIPS assembly.

								<h2>Fpga based Face Detection</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							Towards the end of my first year at university, we had to do a project that involved processing a video stream in real time on an FPGA, i.e. the throughput of system had to be 1 so for every pixel input from the video camera, there was one pixel output onto a screen. <br><br>

							A classmate of mine and I decided to task ourselves with the ambitious project of detecting faces on a video screen. After planning the project, we decided to implement it such that if we used a mouse to hover a box over different parts of the video, the box would go green when there was a face within it. <br><br> 

							Although not a roaring success, the video below is what we managed to get done by the end of about 5 weeks. The video is coloured in black and white as part of the project involved deciding if each pixel was a skin coloured pixel or not. So all the white pixels are what the algorithm thought were skin coloured pixels and the black ones that weren't. <br><br>
